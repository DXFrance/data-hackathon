# Power BI

You can get most information from <http://PowerBI.com>.

Power BI is a dataviz service. You can use it for free, but you need to register with a professional e-mail address.

In order to author those reports, you can download for free and use [Power BI desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/). 
You can also use Power BI Desktop alone if you don't need to share your results.
